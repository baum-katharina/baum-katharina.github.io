Hi, I’m Katharina Baum. I am a researcher focused on understanding how social media impacts both individuals and society. My work looks at topics like privacy, well-being, and how technology can be designed to support a healthier and more sustainable digital experience. I use methods like surveys, experiments, and computational analysis to get a well-rounded view of these challenges.

I’ve always enjoyed exploring questions that sit at the intersection of technology and human behavior. My background in economics, behavioral sciences, and information systems gives me a unique perspective on how digital tools shape our lives. I also love teaching and mentoring, especially when it comes to data science and research methods.

When I’m not working, I enjoy diving into new ideas, collaborating on meaningful projects, and finding ways to use technology to make a positive difference. Let’s connect and see where our interests align!
