Hi, I’m Katharina Baum. I am a researcher focused on understanding how social media impacts both individuals and society. My work looks at topics like privacy, well-being, and how technology can be designed to support a healthier and more sustainable digital experience. I use methods like surveys, experiments, and computational analysis to get a well-rounded view of these challenges.
<p>I’ve always enjoyed exploring questions that sit at the intersection of technology and human behavior. My background in economics, behavioral sciences, and information systems gives me a unique perspective on how digital tools shape our lives. I also love teaching and mentoring, especially when it comes to data science and research methods.</p>
<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy diving into new ideas, collaborating on meaningful projects, and finding ways to use technology to make a positive difference. Let’s connect and see where our interests align!</p>
